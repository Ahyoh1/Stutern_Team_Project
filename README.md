<h1> Wine Quality </h1>

<p> Quality wines come in all colors, all degrees of sweetness and dryness, and all flavor profiles. 
Just because a wine is high quality doesn’t mean that you’ll actually enjoy it, any more than a 
three-star rating means that you’ll love a particular restaurant. Personal taste is simply more
 relevant than quality in choosing a wine. </p>

<h2> Aim and Objective </h2> 

<p> The aim of this project is to use the provided dataset which determines the quality of a wine on 
a scale of 3 to 8. </p>
<p> An explorative, descriptive and predictive analysis is carried out on the dataset and each observations were 
recorded and meaningful insights were gain from them. </p>

<h2> Results and Accuracy </h2>

<p> The best performing model has been random forest classifier. A <strong> RMSE </strong > value of 
<strong> 0.62 </strong> was recorded and this to some extent is good. Further test can be carried out on same dataset 
to improve on the accuracy </p>
